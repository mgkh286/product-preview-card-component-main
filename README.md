## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```html
 <button>
          <img src="images/icon-cart.svg" alt="cart" />
          <span>Add to Cart</span>
        </button>
```
```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```


### Continued development

i will focus on using flexbox layout in the future projects. These concepts am comfortable with and i found it very useful .
also i will focus on using flexbox child layout in the future projects.
i will focus on using relative units vh or vw it helps me to write short and clean code.
i will focus on specificity using class or id selectors .
i will focus in using background and it's properties .


### Useful resources

- [w3schools 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for centering elemens . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Relative length units . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
