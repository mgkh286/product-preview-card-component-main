## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

i will focus on using flexbox layout in the future projects. These concepts am comfortable with and i found tit very useful .

i will focus on using relative units vh or vw it helps me to write short and clean code

i will focus on specificity using class or id selectors


### Useful resources

- [w3schools 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me for centering elemens . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [w3schools 2](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Relative length units . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
